          Playermon was conceptualized to become the next leading social
          creative metaverse, a play-to-earn NFT game in the blockchain industry
          - a game accessible to everyone, with low entry costs, and provides
          players, creators, and investors with the ability to generate income
          based on their creativity and &#34;playformance&#34;. We aim to
          empower the Playermon community creators, players, and investors!
          <br />
          <br />
          We believe that the metaverse future is about the community where
          work, play and social can happen in the virtual space. We believe in
          empowering the creativity in a community where they could express
          their creativity and show it off to the public in the metaverse while
          enjoying the economic opportunities created.
          <br />
          <br />
          We understand that making a metaverse game and community requires
          time, so in Playermon, we have our tokenomics planned for 10 years
          instead of 2/3 years. Team token, play reward, staking reward are
          allocated for 10 years.
